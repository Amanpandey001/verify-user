# verify-user
so, when user sign ups, a verify token link will be forwarded to his email (automated) and when he clicks on that link and verifies himself, then only he will allowed in, we'll also be creating forgotpassword type thingy :D

also im learning this rn, so ill be uploading things as i continue to learn

modules and texh used: mailtrap, nodemailer, mongodb atlas, mongoose, nextjs- javascript 
i prefer mongodb compass ngl cuz gui but there isnt any tutorial available so, ill be learning using mongodb atlas and ill try to migrate on mongodb compass :D

## LOGS

7/aug/24- created backend to save user credentials on db and to send automated testing email , no front end developed yet, pls use your own .env things

8/aug/24= backend creation is almost completed, login, logout, user verification etc, some middleware and optimizations remains that ill do after developing front end, learned- debugging , man the errors , i dont like it
- done with frontend part, now only optimizations remains, also fuck atlas , mongodb compass solos ðŸ˜ 
- done with this app, ignore nav bar cuz.. its confusing, to navigate u can just directly input path on url lol,
also i have added middleware too so beware while navigating, and i have migrated this 'app' on mongodb compass cuz all my homies (including me) hate atlas (cuz i dont know how to use it yet, ill learn abt it later, i mean its used in big tech companies so obv its smth important)

Thanks for visiting this project, im all open to suggestions and corrections regarding this project, actually i would love it so please do refer my code and suggest me some modification or upgrades, i have one in mind and that is to use uuid instead of bcryptjs cuz... url friendly token :)
